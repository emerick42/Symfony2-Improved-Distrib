#Tillid Hub

The Tillid Hub application aims to manage communication between Tillid and everyone.
There is actually two mains axes : the blog and the services created by Tillid.

##The blog

Tillid Hub helps users to publish articles about everything they want.
To make the most of us write blog posts, the interface should be really intuitive and easy to learn.
The article writing should not be a pain, that's why many features will manage the content automatically.
For example, menues should be created automatically in function of the tags used in the redaction.
The blog should manage everything usual :
 * categories
 * tags
 * automatic posts on Twitter/Facebook
 * post-dated publishing

##Services

Tillid Hub helps Tillid to communicate about their new projects.
This application allows the user to add project by a click.
For each project, a dedicated webpage will be automatically created. This webpage will then be overwritable to use any other bundle.
An API will be provided to help other applications (or other bundles at least) to access data about the service. This will allow the user to manage everything with the same administration panel.
Each service will then publish news when possible. All these updates will be visible on the homepage.
There will also be widget displayed on every page to promote services. If the user read a Symfony article, the widget should display information about public Symfony bundles created by Tillid.
A Github link can also be added for each service to promote it.
