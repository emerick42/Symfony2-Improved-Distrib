#Symfony2-Improved-Distrib

A Symfony2 distrib improved with FOSUserBundle, DoctrineFixtures and DoctrineExtensions. It also includes Yui-compressor. Everything is preconfigured. You just have to create your own bundle, reconfigure the secured area (default is /admin) and create the User entity in your bundle.
I hope this will help kickstart your projects.
